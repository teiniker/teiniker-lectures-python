# HTTP Protocol 

The **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is the foundation of data 
communication on the web. It is a stateless, application-layer protocol 
used for transmitting hypermedia documents like HTML between a client 
(usually a web browser) and a server. 

HTTP works via a **request-response model**, where the client sends a 
request (e.g., GET, POST) and the server responds with the requested 
resource or an appropriate status code. 

The most common versions are HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and the newer HTTP/3, 
which introduces performance improvements.
