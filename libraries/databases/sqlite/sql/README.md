# Structured Query Language 

The **Structured Query Language (SQL)** is the main means of interacting with 
nearly all modern relational database systems. 
SQL provides commands to configure the tables, indexes, and other data 
structures within the database. 
SQL commands are also used to insert, update, and delete data records, as 
well as query those records to look up specific data values.

All interaction with a relational database is done through the SQL language. 
This is true when **interactively typing commands** or when using the 
**programming API**.
