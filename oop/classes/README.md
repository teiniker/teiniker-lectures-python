# Classes

In **object-oriented programming** we write **classes** that represent real-world things 
and situations, and we create **objects** based on these classes.

When we write a class, we define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have. 
When we create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the 
general behavior; we can then give each object whatever unique properties we desire.

Making an object from a class is called **instantiation**, and we work with instances of 
a class (a.k.a. objects).

## Defining a Class
Class names should be written in CamelCaps.
Instance and module names should be written in lowercase with underscores between words. 
Every class should have a docstring immediately following the class definition.

_Example_: Resistor
```Python
class Resistor():
    """Simulates a resistor with a given tolerance."""

    def __init__(self, value, tolerance=2):
        self._value = value              
        self._tolerance = tolerance       

    def get_value(self):
        return self._value

    def get_tolerance(self):
        return self._tolerance
``` 

### The `__init__()` Method 
This method Python runs automatically whenever we create a **new instance of a class**.

The **self parameter** is required in the method definition, and it must come first before 
the other parameters.
Every method call associated with a class automatically passes self, which is a reference 
to the instance itself; 
it gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class.


### Attributes
Attributes created in `__init__()` are called **instance attributes**. 
An instance attribute’s value is specific to a particular instance of the class.

On the other hand, **class attributes** are attributes that have the same value for all 
class instances. 
We can define a class attribute by assigning a value to a variable name outside of `__init__()`.

**Private attributes** that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don't exist in Python.
There is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a **name prefixed with two underscores** 
(e.g. `__value`) 
should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member).

Every attribute in a class needs an initial value, even if that value is 0 or an empty string. 
In some cases, such as when setting a **default value**, it makes sense to specify this initial value in 
the body of the `__init__()` method.

We can **change an attribute’s value** in three ways: 
* We can change the value directly through an instance
* Set the value through a method
* Increment the value (add a certain amount to it) through a method.


### Methods
Instance methods are functions that are defined inside a class and can only be called from an instance 
of that class. 
An instance method’s first parameter is always `self`.


### Access Modifiers in Python 

Object-oriented languages, like C++ and Java, use various keywords to control 
and restrict the resource usage of a class.

This is where keywords like `public`, `private` and `protected` come into the picture. However, Python has a different way of providing the functionality of these access modifiers.

* **Public**\
   Public members of a class are available to everyone. 
   So they can be accessed from outside the class and also by other classes too.

   All members of a class are by **default** public in Python. 
   These members can be accessed outside of the class, and their values can be modified too.

* **Protected**\
    protected members of a class can be accessed by other members within the class and are also available to their subclasses.
    No other entity can access these members. 

    Python has a unique convention to make a member protected: Add a prefix `_` (single underscore). This prevents its usage by outside entities unless it is a subclass.

    The attribute defined in the above program is accessible outside the class scope. It can also be modified as well.

* **Private**\
The private members of a class are only accessible within the class. 

In Python, a private member can be defined by using a prefix `__` (double underscore).

Python performs name mangling on private attributes. 
Every member with a double underscore will be changed to `_object._class__variable`.

Double underscores are not very common in practice.
If we need to define attibutes as private, we use a single underscore, and respect the Python convention that it is a private attribute.


### Properties
Poperties are used when we need to define **access control** to some attributes in 
an object.

In other programming languages like Java, we create accress methods (getters and setters) but in Python we use properties instead.

```Python
    @property
    def tolerance(self):
        return self._tolerance

    @tolerance.setter
    def tolerance(self, tolerance):
        if tolerance < 0:
            raise ValueError('Invalid tolerance!')
        self._tolerance = tolerance
```

The `@property` method will return the value held by a private attribute.

The `@<property-name>.setter` method takes a value and validates it before 
the value will be stored in a private attrbute.

```Python
r1 = Resistor(100,1)
assert 100 == r1.value
assert 1 == r1.tolerance
```
Note that the usage of properties is **transparent to the code outside a class**.


## Making an Class Instance

When Python reads the following line, it calls the `__init__()` method:

_Example_: 
```Python
r1 = Resistor(2700,2)
r2 = Resistor(2700,2)
``` 

The `__init__()` method has no explicit return statement, but Python automatically returns an instance.
We can create as many instances from a class as we need.


## Accessing Attributes and Calling Methods

To **access the attribute** of an instance, we use the **dot notation**.

To **call a method**, give the name of the instance and the method we want to call, separated by a dot.

_Example_: 
```Python
r1.value = 1000
r2.add(r1)
``` 


## Magic (Dunder) Methods

Python does all operations (`+`, `*`, `==`, etc.) using magic methods. 
These special methods have a naming convention, where the name starts with two underscores, followed 
by an identifier and ends with another pair of underscores.

Essentially, each built-in function or operator has a special method corresponding to it. 
For example, there’s `__eq__()`, corresponding to `==`, and `__add__()`, corresponding to the `+` operator.

By default, most of the built-ins and operators will not work with objects of our classes. 
We must add the corresponding special methods in our class definition to make our object compatible with 
built-ins and operators.

Due to the naming convention used for these methods, they are also called **dunder methods** which is a shorthand 
for **d**ouble **under**score methods. Sometimes they’re also referred to as special methods or **magic methods**. 


### The `__repr__()` Method
Python `__repr__()` function returns the object representation in string format. 
This method is called when `repr()` function is invoked on the object. 
If possible, the string returned should be **a valid Python expression that can be used to reconstruct the object again**.

_Example_: 
```Python
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Resistor({}, {})'.format(self.get_value(), self.get_tolerance())
``` 


### The `__str__()` Method
This method returns the **string representation of the object**. 
This method is called when `print()` or `str()` function is invoked on an object.

This method must return the String object. 
If we don’t implement `__str__()` function for a class, then built-in object 
implementation is used that actually calls `__repr__()` function.

We should always use `str()` function, which will call the underlying `__str__()` function. 
It’s not a good idea to use the `__str__()` function directly.

_Example_: 
```Python
    def __str__(self):
        return 'Resistor: value={}, tolerance={}'.format(self.get_value(), self.get_tolerance())    
``` 


### The `__eq__()` Method
There are various ways using which the objects of any type in Python can be compared. 
The `==` operator compares the value or equality of two objects, whereas the Python `is` operator checks 
whether two variables point to the same object in memory.

Python automatically calls the `__eq__()` method of a class when you use the `==` operator 
to compare the instances of the class. 
By default, Python uses the `is` operator if you don’t provide a specific implementation for 
the `__eq__()` method.

_Example_: 
```Python
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if self._value == other._value and self._tolerance == other._tolerance:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

### The `__add__()` Method
The special method corresponding to the `+` operator is the `__add__()` method. 
Adding a custom definition of `__add__()` changes the behavior of the operator. 
It is recommended that `__add__()` returns a new instance of the class instead of modifying the 
calling instance itself. 

_Example_: 
```Python
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Resistor(self._value + other._value)
``` 


## Inheritance
When one class inherits from another, it automatically **takes on all the attributes and methods of the 
first class**. The original class is called the **parent class**, and the new class is the **child class**.
The child class inherits every attribute and method from its parent class but is also free to define 
new attributes and methods of its own.

When we create a child class, the parent class must be part of the current file and must appear before 
the child class in the file. 
The name of the parent class must be included in parentheses in the definition of the child class.

The `super()` function is a special function that helps Python make connections between the parent and 
child class. The name super comes from a convention of calling the parent class a **superclass** and 
the child class a **subclass**.

The `__init__()` method for a child class needs help from its parent class, so it calls 
`super().__init__()` to inizialize the attributes of the parent class.

Once we have a child class that inherits from a parent class, we can 
**add any new attributes and methods** necessary to differentiate the child class from the parent class.

We can **override** any method from the parent class that doesn’t fit what we’re trying to model with the child class. 
To do this, we define a method in the child class with the same name as the method you want to override in the parent class.
Python will disregard the parent class method and only pay attention to the method you define in the child class.
