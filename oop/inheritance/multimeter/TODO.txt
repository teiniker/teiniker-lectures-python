Exercise: OOP Refactoring
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the two classes "Voltmeter" and "Amperemeter" which implement nearly the 
same set of attributes.

Refactor the given Python code:

A) Extract Base Class
Write an abstract base class (ABC) named "Instrument" which implements the common 
attributes and a coresponding constructor.
Inherit "Voltmeter" and "Amperemeter" from "Instrument".
Define the "measured_value()" method as abstract method, so the each subclass has 
to implement this method.

Note that the verification code (assert statements) should NOT be changed during 
the refactoring.
