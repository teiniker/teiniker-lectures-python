# Loops

## for Loop

The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence 
(such as a list, tuple, dictionary, string, or range) and 
execute a block of code multiple times.

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to execute
```

* `variable` is a temporary placeholder that takes each 
    value from the sequence (list, tuple, range, etc.).
* `sequence` is the collection of elements that the loop 
    will iterate through.
* The indented block of code executes for each iteration.
