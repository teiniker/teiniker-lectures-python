Exercise: Conditions, Loops, Functions - Min, Max, Mean Value
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement the following functions:

A) min_value(lst)
Calculate the minimum value of the given list.

B) max_value(lst)
Calculate the maximum value of the given list.

C) mean_value(lst)
Calculate the mean value of the given list.

Remember, directly comparing floating point numbers using "==" can 
be problematic due to precision issues inherent in floating point 
arithmetic. 

For many cases, especially in tests involving computed means, small 
rounding errors might cause an equality check to fail unexpectedly.

A more robust approach is to use a tolerance-based comparison. 
Pythonâ€™s math.isclose function (available in Python 3.5+) is well-suited 
for this purpose.
