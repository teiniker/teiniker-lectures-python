# Jupyter Notebook 

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows users to 
create and share **documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, 
and narrative text**. It is widely used for data science, machine learning, 
scientific computing, and academic research.

* **Interactive Computing**: Users can write and execute code in real-time, 
    making it ideal for experimentation and data analysis.

* **Supports Multiple Languages**: Though primarily associated with Python, 
    Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages, including R, Julia, and Scala.

* **Markdown Support**: Allows users to add formatted text, headings, bullet 
    points, links, and images to document workflows effectively.

* **Code Execution and Output**: Users can execute individual code cells, view 
    outputs immediately, and rerun specific parts of the notebook without 
    re-executing the entire script.

* **Data Visualization**: Jupyter integrates well with libraries like Matplotlib, 
    Seaborn, and Plotly, enabling users to create interactive charts and graphs 
    within the notebook.

* **Notebook Sharing**: Notebooks can be exported in various formats (HTML, PDF, 
    LaTeX) and shared easily via platforms like GitHub and JupyterHub.

* **Extensibility**: Users can enhance functionality using extensions like Jupyter 
    Widgets for interactive controls and JupyterLab for an enhanced user interface.

* **Integration with Cloud Services**: Can be run locally or on cloud platforms 
    like Google Colab, AWS SageMaker, and Microsoft Azure Notebooks.

Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in education, research, and industry for their 
flexibility and ease of use, making them a powerful tool for interactive computing 
and collaboration.


## Setup 

Jupyter Notebook can be installed using the Python package manager `pip`:

* **Jupyter Notebook** offers a simplified, lightweight notebook authoring experience

```bash
$ pip3 install jupyter
$ jupyter notebook
```    

* **JupyterLab** offers a feature-rich, tabbed multi-notebook editing environment with 
    additional tools like a customizable interface layout and system console

```bash
$ pip3 install jupyterlab
$ jupyter lab
```
