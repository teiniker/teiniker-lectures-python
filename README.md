# Python Programming by Example

In this repository, we use the Python programming language to learn about different testing techniques.
For this reason, it is important to understand the basics of Python.
Fortunately, Python is a very common language and there are numerous freely available resources on the Internet.

If you need help on individual topics related to Python programming, first check the official
[Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).

To get access to all the facts about Python you can follow these two sources:
* [The Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html)
* [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)

There is also a **Python style guide** which defines coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library
in the main Python distribution:
* [Introduction](coding-style-guide/README.md)
* [PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

The following list references numerous **videos** which are created by by engaged authors and freely accessible on YouTube.
Each of these short videos repeats a specific language construct of the Python programming language.
